Hello! I'm Sparsh Palkhiwala, a nerd running on coffee currently diving deep into the fascinating world of Speaker Diarization. My journey has taken me through bits of technology, from developing real-time vehicle detection systems to integrating AI for enhanced efficiency in research and writing processes.

Beyond the technical sphere, I am an melomane, a chess aficionado, and a dedicated gym-rat. These interests help me extreme some balance in the extremes of my life.

Whether it's optimizing data pipelines with MongoDB, fine-tuning language models, or exploring the latest in machine learning and AI, I am driven by curiosity and a desire to innovate.

Let's connect and explore the limitless possibilities of technology together!
