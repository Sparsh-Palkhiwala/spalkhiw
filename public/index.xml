      <description>Little Bit about NavAssist The YOLOv5 model has been meticulously fine-tuned and trained on a custom dataset comprising over 16,000 images, designed to capture Indian surroundings. This finetuned model achieves up to 70% precision in car detection and an overall precision of 65.4% for detecting all vehicles, all while maintaining real-time processing capabilities at 25 frames per second.&#xA;In addition, the model has undergone pruning to enhance resource efficiency, allowing it to run on lightweight devices such as the Jetson Nano.</description>

      <description>Hello! I&amp;rsquo;m Sparsh Palkhiwala, a nerd running on coffee currently diving deep into the fascinating world of Speaker Diarization. My journey has taken me through bits of technology, from developing real-time vehicle detection systems to integrating AI for enhanced efficiency in research and writing processes.&#xA;Beyond the technical sphere, I am an melomane, a chess aficionado, and a dedicated gym-rat. These interests help me extreme some balance in the extremes of my life.</description>
